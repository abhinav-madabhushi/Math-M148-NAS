# Math-M148-NAS
Repo that applies Neural Architecture Search through reinforcement learning to Multi-Layer Perceptrons on different datasets to find the best MLP architecture. Goal is to achieve one-shot learning of the architecture given any dataset. 
- RL_model: Contains code to apply and train a RL model on one dataset to find the best MLP architecture for it.
- RL_generalized: Contains code to apply and train a RL model on multiple datasets to eventually find the best MLP architecture for any given dataset. Does this by extracting data specific features.
- Data_Exploration: Applying specific MLP architecture on datasets based on intuition and generally used architectures to draw a comparison.
